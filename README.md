# Vision-Based Motor Control System

## Description  
This project implements **vision-based motor control** using a **Raspberry Pi camera module** and an **L298N motor driver**. The Raspberry Pi processes video input to detect objects or gestures and directly controls the motors through its **GPIO pins**, eliminating the need for an external microcontroller like Arduino. This enables precise movement based on real-time visual feedback, making it suitable for applications like **robotic navigation** or **automated vehicle systems**.

## Components Used  
- **Raspberry Pi** (for image processing and motor control)  
- **Raspberry Pi Camera Module** (to capture real-time video)  
- **L298N Motor Driver** (to drive the motors)  
- **DC Motors** (for movement)  

## Working Principle  
1. The **Raspberry Pi** captures video using the camera module.  
2. It processes the input and detects specific **gestures or objects**.  
3. Based on the detection, it directly controls the **L298N motor driver** through its **GPIO pins**.  
4. The **motors** respond accordingly to achieve the desired motion.  

## Applications  
- Autonomous Vehicles  
- Gesture-Controlled Robots  
- Object-Tracking Systems
